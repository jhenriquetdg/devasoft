<h2>A household of neuroscience data.</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Science is no longer solitary. Neuroscience is staked in the past. We must share our data. Data reports must be open to society - they pay the bill they get the result.</p>

<h3>Proposal</h3>
I propose a social network that shares data, scripts and reports.

<h3>Aim</h3>
I will focus the development towards behavioral and electrophysiological neuroscience.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
I will utilize Linux as a service, Flask, PostegreSQL, Jupyter and GitHub to create an integrative enviroment to hold Data, analysis functions, reports providing a integrated environment to develop continuous neuroscience advancements.
